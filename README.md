## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   The most challenging thing was figuring out how to continue the game after pressing the button once. I overcame it by making another method
   that checks whether or not the player had finished the sequence. That way when the player does finish the sequence it will play the next
   sequence, continuing the game.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   I don't have many questions about web development, I am just really excited to learn more about it and learn how to develop my own websites and
   improve websites for different companies.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   If I had more time on this project I would add many more features that really distinguish who I am. Examples might be adding pictures
   and changing the color scheme to reflect who I am. A personal version of the game.
